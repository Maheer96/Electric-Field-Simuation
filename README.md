Inspiration taken from: https://scipython.com/blog/the-electric-field-of-a-capacitor/

This project involves a simple simulation of an electric field emitted by a parallel plate capacitor via a multipole arrangement of singular electric charges.
The logic is based in Python with a focus on its mathematical libraries; Matplotlib & NumPy 
The project served as a way for me to be introduced to computational physics/mathematics, an interest that I have had for a long time, hope you enjoy!
